# Module 9 Challenge

# Itâ€™s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

# The EmployeeSQL folder contains every question and answer for Module 9. 

# There is a separate SQL file for the table creations only.

# That specific folder also has a picture of the ERD created, as well as a text document that shows. QuickDBD was used to create the ERD.

# I would like some comments on primary keys please, I feel as though I may have not done that 100% so please let me know.
